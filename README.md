# Level-Up (Task 001)

In this task, we had to implement a simple CLI app that accepts a string and post it to an endpoint (e.g [jsonplaceholder.typicode.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)) satisfying the following rules:

- The string can contain markdown/HTML and the app must sanitize it.
- The string can contain invalid characters (e.g !@#\$%^&\*) and the app must sanitize it.

### How to run

- Clone the project using Git.
- Install Nodejs. NPM will be installed too.
- Navigate to the project's directory.
- `npm install` to install required packages (modules).
- `npx tsc` to transpile TypeScript source files (`*.ts`) into corresponding JavaScript files (`*.js`).
- `node .` to run the app.
